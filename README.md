# ElixirTodoApp

This is my first full stack application using the Phoenix Framework. No tutorials, no follow alongs. Just me figuring out routes, functions, forms, error handling and how to read and debug the compiler's error messages (this is a big one for me).

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Build the docker container with `docker-compose up -d`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
